## Nonresponse in ACS Citizenship Question: Characteristics of Respondents

This research project aims to answer the following question: what are the demographic
characteristics of the people who do not respond to the citizenship question in the ACS survey?
The selected variables for comparison are income levels, family size, industry of employment,
and educational attainment level. Our hypothesis is that people with non-responses on the
citizenship question are more likely to have lower income, larger family size, work in the service
sector, and less education. Most non-responses are likely the vulnerable group of people
residing in the United States who fear that their truthful responses to the citizenship question
may incur negative legal measures such as deportation.

In addition, using the IPUMS data from the American Community Survey between (ACS) 2013 and 2017, we will observe the relationship between the above-mentioned variables and citizenship non-response in five U.S states with a large immigrant population.
